# ESP-Miner Development Guide for Agents

Welcome to the ESP-Miner repository. This document provides a high-level overview of the project structure, build instructions, and CI setup to help you navigate and contribute effectively.

## Project Overview
ESP-Miner is the firmware powering the Bitaxe open-source Bitcoin ASIC miners. It is built on the ESP-IDF framework (v5.x+) for the ESP32-S3 and includes a modern web interface (Axe-OS) built with Angular.

## Build Instructions

### 1. Firmware (Main Project)
The project uses the standard ESP-IDF build system. Ensure you are using ESP-IDF v5.5.1 (or compatible).

**Prerequisites:**
- ESP-IDF v5.5.1 environment sourced.
- Node.js (v22+) and npm for the frontend bundle.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Source the environment
. ~/esp/v5.5.1/esp-idf/export.sh

# Build the project (automatically builds Axe-OS and generates binaries)
idf.py build

# Flash to device
idf.py build flash
```
*Note: The Axe-OS frontend is automatically built and compressed into `www.bin` as part of the main `idf.py build` process.*

### 2. Axe-OS (Frontend)
The frontend is a standalone Angular application located in `main/http_server/axe-os`.

**Commands:**
```bash
cd main/http_server/axe-os
npm install

# Build only the frontend
npm run build

# Run local development server
npm run start
```

## Testing

### Internal C Components
Firmware unit tests are located in the `test/` directory.
```bash
idf.py build test
```

### Axe-OS Frontend
Angular unit tests use Karma and Jasmine. We use a specific CI command for CI environments which ensures consistent reporting and uses a headless browser.

**Execution:**
```bash
cd main/http_server/axe-os
npm run test:ci
```

**Key Points:**
- `npm run test:ci` automatically runs `npm run generate:api` before executing `ng test`.
- It uses a custom `ChromeHeadlessCI` launcher (defined in `karma.conf.js`) with `--no-sandbox` to ensure stability in containerized CI environments.
- Unit tests are highly isolated. **Reminder:** Components with many dependencies (like `HomeComponent`) must have all services, pipes, and sub-components explicitly declared or provided in the `TestBed`.

## CI/CD Setup

We use GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases.

### Key Workflows:
- **`unittest.yml`**: Runs both backend and frontend unit tests in parallel.
- **`build.yml`**: Verifies that the project compiles for all primary configurations.
- **`release.yml`**: Handles automated releases and binary packaging.

## AI Agent Tips
- **API Generation**: If you modify `openapi.yaml`, you **must** run `npm run generate:api` in the `axe-os` directory to update the TypeScript services. This is also automatically handled by `npm run build` and `npm run test:ci`.
- **Node Environment**: If `node` or `npm` are not in your global path, check for local installations in `~/.nvm`. You can source them using `export PATH=~/.nvm/versions/node/v[version]/bin:$PATH`.
- **Modern Angular Testing**: Use functional providers like `provideRouter([])` and `provideHttpClient()` instead of deprecated class-based modules like `RouterTestingModule`.
- **PSRAM**: Bitaxe heavily relies on PSRAM. Always check `esp_psram_is_initialized()` before allocating large buffers in the backend.
- **Mock Data Parity**: When updating `openapi.yaml` and regenerating the API, you **must** update the mock data in `main/http_server/axe-os/src/app/services/system.service.ts`. The TypeScript compiler will fail if properties are missing from the `of()` calls used for development.
- **API Type Safety**: The `SystemInfo` API uses a numeric 0/1 pattern for many boolean-like status fields (e.g., `overclockEnabled`, `overheat_mode`). In the backend, use `cJSON_AddNumberToObject(root, "key", val ? 1 : 0)` to maintain parity with the `integer` types in OpenAPI and support strict equality checks (`=== 1`) in the Angular frontend.
